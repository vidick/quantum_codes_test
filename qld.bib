abstract = {We show that every language in NP has a probablistic verifier that checks membership proofs for it using logarithmic number of random bits and by examining a constant number of bits in the proof. If a string is in the language, then there exists a proof such that the verifier accepts with probability 1 (i.e., for every choice of its random string). For strings not in the language, the verifier rejects every provided “proof” with probability at least 1/2. Our result builds upon and improves a recent result of Arora and Safra [1998] whose verifiers examine a nonconstant number of bits in the proof (though this number is a very slowly growing function of the input length).As a consequence, we prove that no MAX SNP-hard problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme, unless NP = P. The class MAX SNP was defined by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [1991] and hard problems for this class include vertex cover, maximum satisfiability, maximum cut, metric TSP, Steiner trees and shortest superstring. We also improve upon the clique hardness results of Feige et al. [1996] and Arora and Safra [1998] and show that there exists a positive ε such that approximating the maximum clique size in an N-vertex graph to within a factor of Nε is NP-hard.},

Moreover, we show that the produced classical LDPC codes are also asymptotically good and locally testable with constant query and soundness parameters, which proves a well-known conjecture in the field of locally testable codes.},

abstract = {A locally testable code (LTC) is an error correcting code that has a property-tester. The tester reads q bits that are randomly chosen, and rejects words with probability proportional to their distance from the code. The parameter q is called the locality of the tester. LTCs were initially studied as important components of probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP), and since then the topic has evolved on its own. High rate LTCs could be useful in practice: before attempting to decode a received word, one can save time by first quickly testing if it is close to the code. An outstanding open question has been whether there exist “c3-LTCs”, namely LTCs with constant rate, constant distance, and constant locality. In this work we construct such codes based on a new two-dimensional complex which we call a left-right Cayley complex. This is essentially a graph which, in addition to vertices and edges, also has squares. Our codes can be viewed as a two-dimensional version of (the one-dimensional) expander codes, where the codewords are functions on the squares rather than on the edges.},
